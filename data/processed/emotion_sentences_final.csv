her sympathies I came up against another immovable wall.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_094,sadness,15

her sympathy did not alter her convictions.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_094,sadness,44
"Here was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here
was she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a

my professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any
terms.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_095,joy,27

all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,
deeper, more “natural” feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to

shame to see our slums and hospitals.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_098,sadness,12

acclimated, she had never seen.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_099,sadness,16

kissing her hungrily.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_101,joy,13

much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much
happiness.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_102,joy,19

heart lifted with that tide of race-motherhood which was their supreme
passion, could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to
be a mother.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_102,joy,39

which, two thousand years ago, that dwindling band of women had watched
the miracle of virgin birth, was the deep awe and warm expectancy with
which they greeted this new miracle of union.",Herland,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,1915,CP_103,joy,39
"And I
was beginning to find that Ellador’s friendship, Ellador’s comradeship,

done, her shoulders rising and falling with great regularity.",The Voyage Out,Virginia Woolf,1915,VW_002,sadness,20

"And there is a dignity in people; a solitude; even between husband and
wife a gulf; and that one must respect, thought Clarissa, watching
him open the door; for one would not part with it oneself, or take
it, against his will, from one’s husband, without losing one’s
independence, one’s self-respect--something, after all, priceless.",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf,1925,VW_081,joy,54

party.",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf,1925,VW_116,joy,9

her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be; to exist; to

perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element.",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf,1925,VW_118,joy,56

What business had the Bradshaws to talk of death at her party?,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf,1925,VW_125,surprise,12
"Then (she had felt it only this morning) there was the terror; the
overwhelming incapacity, one’s parents giving it into one’s hands, this
life, to be lived to the end, to be walked with serenely; there was in
the depths of her heart an awful fear.",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf,1925,VW_126,fear,46

independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at
length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable—I,
weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits

pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my
establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit
down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,

she vainly strove to hide from my mockery.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_047,joy,20

her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he
yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step
in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink
beneath his former level.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_047,sadness,52

assiduously with my occupation.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_049,sadness,16

vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up

escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable
one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_055,joy,36

an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which
I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_055,fear,35

not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back

us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded

Catherine’s tears were more powerful than ours.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_063,sadness,13

agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to

with her—your mistress.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_065,joy,9

pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_069,joy,12

liked to be there!”",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_072,sadness,18

consolation.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_073,sadness,11

to the truth and not slander me, even in joke!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_074,joy,33

enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and
I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me
beyond expression.”",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_075,sadness,33

Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_075,joy,17

you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_075,surprise,13

well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her
up.”",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_075,joy,17

Miss, when he told you he hated her?”",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_079,surprise,24

giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on
silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to
be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_079,anger,38

neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your
intimacy with—” “Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,
“for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_083,joy,48

so dreadful to watch Catherine go.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_086,fear,18

face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and
brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s
injunction that she should not be crossed.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_086,fear,36
"Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually
passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of
shame.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_088,fear,24

now, her face bathed in tears.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_088,sadness,9

mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;
pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_090,sadness,25

speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified
astonishment.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_090,fear,21

arms, and looked at her with anguish.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_090,sadness,14

I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_091,joy,13

than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a
handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_092,surprise,27

mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could
have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_092,surprise,31
But she’s a real little fool.,Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_093,anger,6

ascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was
empty.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_093,joy,12

of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve
around her perfect and constant tranquillity.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_093,joy,29

spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_094,sadness,24

inquired.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_094,surprise,14
"Day and night he was watching,
and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a
shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he
saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the
source of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength
were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no
limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of
danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the
gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes
with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance
also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_095,joy,121

under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the
air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_095,joy,39
"And
there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that
of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s
heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger’s
gripe, by the birth of an heir.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_096,joy,45

on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my
thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_097,joy,30
"I inquired whether
I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_098,surprise,14
"You’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,
seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and
remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing
the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the
Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass
them!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_099,sadness,58
"and—mind
you don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose
pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally
against Heathcliff!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_099,sadness,26

and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,
which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_099,sadness,30
"As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and
informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a
letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her
ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as
early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_103,joy,62

may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that
I am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can
never think she’ll be happy.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_104,sadness,34
"Mr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the
Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,
when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines
to console Isabella.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_104,sadness,44
"I daresay she had been on the watch for me since
morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden
causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being
observed.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_104,fear,41
"She came forward eagerly to greet me, and
held out one hand to take the expected letter.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_104,joy,17

blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended
by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future
interference with his family, for good or evil.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_105,joy,34
"But do you imagine that
I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_105,surprise,14
"and can you
compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_105,surprise,10

Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would
restrains me.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_105,joy,24

period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my
return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance
could make me admit the horrible idea again.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_106,fear,39

I remarked.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_106,sadness,15

is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been
brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_107,joy,38
"It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
discover that I did not love her.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_107,sadness,15
"And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she
announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually
succeeded in making her hate me!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_107,sadness,27
"Can I
trust your assertion, Isabella?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_107,surprise,6

pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_107,surprise,23
"I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire
to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only
wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to
ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_109,joy,52

nerves, and she couldn’t bear the surprise, I’m positive.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_109,joy,11

in her frightful isolation?",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_109,fear,11

gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:

children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not
rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave
them!’",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_113,joy,36
"After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she
resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:— “Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the
grave.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_114,sadness,33
"And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this
shattered prison, after all.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_114,sadness,16

observe that Catherine’s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung
down.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_116,joy,23

before: “Incomparably beyond and above us all!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_117,joy,18

even in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s
blessed release!",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_118,surprise,24

Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of
deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_124,sadness,24

little more.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_131,sadness,24
"Grief,
and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up
his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the
village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within
the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on
the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or
early morning before other wanderers were abroad.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_131,sadness,70

perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,

second journey would make us better judges.",Wuthering Heights,Emily Brontë,1847,EB_187,sadness,49

girl asleep, a pair of hollow, dark eyes opened wide, and looked up at

distinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob’s mother was a
dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the
river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed
out a brindled dog that wouldn’t stop barking; and when Bob’s mother
came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them not to
be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her
heart beat with terror.",The Mill on the Floss,George Eliot,1860,GE_035,fear,86

she looked through her tears at the vague distance.",The Mill on the Floss,George Eliot,1860,GE_043,sadness,59

leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet, she
endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else

other part of her inherited share in the hard-won treasures of thought
which generations of painful toil have laid up for the race of men,

much futile information about Saxon and other kings of doubtful
example, but unhappily quite without that knowledge of the irreversible
laws within and without her, which, governing the habits, becomes
morality, and developing the feelings of submission and dependence,
becomes religion,—as lonely in her trouble as if every other girl

curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had

"“I’m frightened; I shall run away,” said Maggie, making a laughing
retreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to
the farther end of the room; not very far either,—a touch of human

repent.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_045,sadness,7

two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at
last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known
charade, My first doth affliction denote,

pages ago already.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_047,sadness,68

again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then

all the dessert.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_059,sadness,61

out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had
ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration
of friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the
children with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months
old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to
be danced about in her aunt’s arms.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_065,joy,75

it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_070,sadness,19

Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,

excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not
speak of her loss without many tears.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_072,sadness,53
"Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s
complaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat
about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.
Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often
alarmed her with them.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_073,sadness,51
"Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and
care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she
could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist
than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject, “It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like
snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I
should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from
venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel
the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so
great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_073,sadness,137

to be Mr. Elton’s object?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_075,surprise,16
"Mr. Elton and I
are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing
herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a
partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of
high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very
well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and
in want of counsel.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_075,joy,66

quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_076,fear,15

when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing
before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,
by no means better, rather worse.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_076,sadness,48

"This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not
afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but
the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was
grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of
Mr. Elton’s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all
that was enjoyable to the utmost.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_078,joy,67

sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close
to her.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_079,sadness,28

see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my
son—and then I should say we were quite complete.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_080,joy,24

his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their
party quite complete.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_080,joy,27

the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to
speak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very
fond of him.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_081,joy,45

caprice?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_081,joy,12

never had any children!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_082,joy,9

have made them!”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_082,sadness,10
Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.,Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_082,joy,9
"It did appear—there was no concealing
it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of
Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_084,disgust,28
"A few minutes
more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his
own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and
happiness when this visit of hardship were over.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_086,joy,37

would not like it.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_086,fear,9

be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to
the passing hour.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_087,joy,22

fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very
sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_088,sadness,20

overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence
being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he
tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed— “Charming Miss Woodhouse!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_088,joy,40
"Am I to believe that you
have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss
Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_089,surprise,23
"The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think
and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow
of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every
thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of
all.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_090,anger,49
"It was
dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many
respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;
proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little
concerned about the feelings of others.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_091,fear,41

this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any
body else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_092,sadness,42
"The distressing explanation she had to make to
Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the
awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or
discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing
resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most
unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last
with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most
dreadfully.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_093,sadness,70
"These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of
snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome
that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_093,joy,37
Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr.,Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_094,joy,5
"Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no
dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she
listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and
understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the
superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for
her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence
could do.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_095,sadness,71
"Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in
fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man
had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever
expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by
any proportionate depression.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_096,sadness,49

Mr. Frank Churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at
Randalls.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_097,sadness,26

coming back again.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_098,joy,16
"Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied
the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized
apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most
cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who
with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to
give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking
daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks
for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after
Mr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her mother’s, and
sweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_102,joy,94

us.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_116,joy,37

be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_118,joy,22
"Dear,
Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_119,sadness,7

them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did
this make in the evils of the connexion?",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_120,surprise,23
"Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_120,sadness,13

mortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what
appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right
lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_121,sadness,41
"He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and
was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his
own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and,
with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of
the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously
gallant.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_122,joy,61

some attorney, and too stupid to rise.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_123,anger,15

talked her into love; but, alas!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_123,sadness,8

separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to
herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little
consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure
it.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_126,sadness,43

disappointed.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_126,sadness,18

of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr.

to see him so well.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_126,joy,39

was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice
in their joy.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_126,joy,24

coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped Mr.

different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as
before.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_127,joy,25

resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its
object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of
her person.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_129,surprise,32

their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her
mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be
considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_129,surprise,44

Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_130,joy,21

saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she
mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely
enough to live on.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_130,sadness,33

doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort

only ordinarily gifted with it.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_131,joy,45

obliged to you for your preparatory hint.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_134,sadness,20

me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_134,sadness,18

very strong proof.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_136,joy,17

thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_137,joy,36
"Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,
if they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be
giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_140,sadness,28

spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the
omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_140,sadness,34
"She loves piquet, you
know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by
yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of
that would entirely destroy my comfort.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_142,fear,39

"Mrs. Cole was telling that
she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room
had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking
instrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the
substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of
surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and
explanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived
from Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt
and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,
Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could
possibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied
that it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from
Colonel Campbell.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_145,surprise,134
"Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,

enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still
listen to Mrs. Cole.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_145,joy,56

penance; there it would have been all enjoyment.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_147,joy,18

seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say
nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_148,joy,31
"Jane Fairfax
did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad
to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the
mortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in
vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself
beloved by the husband of her friend.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_148,joy,55

been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a

you.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_151,joy,10

Miss Bates and her niece came here?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_151,surprise,11

know.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_152,joy,15

do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_153,joy,33

Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking
him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind

Knightley; consequently to Isabella.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_155,sadness,13

most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great
deduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could
not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_155,sadness,40

his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it
too much.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_177,sadness,45

headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball

sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very
much.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet’s attachment had been

him, had in all likelihood been given also.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_190,joy,65

she used to be—And I love an open temper.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_195,joy,17

you say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_195,joy,21

old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years
hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_198,joy,26

now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on
such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his
particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her—and with all
his mildest urbanity, said, “I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning
in the rain.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_199,sadness,58

rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do
such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_199,sadness,41

too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could
catch his eye again.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_221,joy,36

style—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,
Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,
excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of
sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.
Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all
out again.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_222,sadness,64
"It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which
she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely
glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the
Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much
alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was
peculiarly gratifying.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_224,joy,62
"The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few
minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward
to another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s infatuation.—From
Harriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted
the ballroom, she had strong hopes.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_224,joy,57

her.—The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards

an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for
she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent

nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having
mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with
all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of
it before, of course it must have been a dream.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_233,joy,57

quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,
who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.
Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in
lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor
little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter
near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_235,joy,67

took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and

Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_248,joy,21

Churchill so silent and stupid.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_248,anger,10

appear—.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_276,joy,12

things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place
than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if
such a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be
so fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should
really—if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss
Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put
difficulties in the way.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_276,joy,84

have.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_276,joy,12

her.—How to understand it all!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_279,surprise,21

been thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the
blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about,
she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every
posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had
been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had
been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was
wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of
wretchedness.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_279,sadness,91

declared him now to be?",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_279,surprise,18

knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she
reached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most
sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed
to her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind
was disgusting.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_280,disgust,47

must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the
sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification
and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to
himself.—Could it be?—No; it was impossible.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_280,fear,47

perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek

causes) to direct the human fate?",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_280,surprise,46

how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,
first in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling
it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the
dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had
been.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no
female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims
could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far
he loved and esteemed Isabella.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_281,joy,103

recent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her
behaviour to Miss Bates!",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_281,surprise,20

to irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to
beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it
to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_
topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were
allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of
others—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as
if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,
and approved, and was grateful.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_282,joy,89

satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her
daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a
gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_283,joy,32
"Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first
reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always
feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the
cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good
deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_284,sadness,55

opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish

"When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from
a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few
seconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or
composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better
conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might
be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it
would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and
leave her less to regret when it were gone.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_287,joy,100

will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment
of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not
farther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure
myself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that
there was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to
deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded

creature.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_289,sadness,86

already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it
may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,
then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_291,joy,55

what she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a

indulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of
even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But
I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_296,joy,64

friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I
ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped
from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge
myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,
more than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to
me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of
intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss
Woodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the
declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would
not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and
delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young
woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any
tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my
wish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured
playfulness, which exactly suited me.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_297,joy,180

her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her
attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards
her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what
you saw amiss.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_298,joy,44

procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of
that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly

myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,
you have now a key to.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_298,joy,59

of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and
patience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I
recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve
to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_299,joy,49

entered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to
leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been
walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make
the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most
mortifying retrospect for me.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_299,joy,59

the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on
me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other
letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting
that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,
remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did
not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was
too busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We
removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from
her, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by
the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest
reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could
not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to
have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she
now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that
if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury
within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in
short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me
in the face.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_301,sadness,226

that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the
secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,
was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_301,joy,37

not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,

the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my
uncle.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_301,surprise,42

the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I
was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not
disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object
of my journey.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_301,sadness,55

ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will
dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I
deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good
fortune.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_302,joy,53

undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself, Your obliged and affectionate Son, F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_302,joy,28

present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not
come till Miss Fairfax was here.”",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_303,joy,37

inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion
in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he
is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it
may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am
very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers
the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_305,joy,79

considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped

herself to avoid a meeting.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_307,joy,19

talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense

her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much
might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the
feelings which she had led astray herself.",Emma,Jane Austen,1815,JA_307,sadness,66

fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s

because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in
her sleep.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_047,joy,30

what isn’t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had
hoped.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_047,joy,21

that a greater was given her.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_047,joy,17

she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads
popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,
several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_048,joy,38

look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a
little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed
like a sign board to “Miss Elizabeth March.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_048,surprise,34

hid her face in Jo’s apron, quite upset by her present.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_048,sadness,13

to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever
been before.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_049,joy,28

order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the
happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly
touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright
pedals.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_049,joy,48

idea of the child’s really going never entered her head.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_049,joy,26

looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a
small quaver in her voice, “I came to thank you, sir, for...”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_049,joy,35

expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her
surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, “Well, I do believe
the world is coming to an end.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_050,surprise,45

see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few
enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,
seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop
down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_053,sadness,63

little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_053,sadness,21

school.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_054,joy,12

comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and
princesses, Jo’s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_056,joy,25

queen’s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she
amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her
‘sorry for it’.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_057,joy,29

humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do

again,” cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_057,joy,21

pet.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_058,sadness,14

not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their mother
read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and
the sweet home peace was disturbed.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_058,sadness,32

grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she
felt so deeply injured that she really couldn’t quite forgive yet.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_059,sadness,38

and nothing went well all day.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_059,sadness,13

crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo’s
heart stand still with fear.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_060,fear,61

golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever

when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,

reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them
copy.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_062,joy,50

the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial

the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than
that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_063,sadness,58

fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,” replied Jo, looking like

novelty and pleasure.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_066,joy,17

good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a
winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went
to take her first taste of fashionable life.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_066,joy,44

agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best
frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_066,joy,24

exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of
those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,
crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as
well as she could.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_066,joy,45

dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt
that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the
new gloves and silk stockings.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_066,sadness,37

bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box

girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_067,surprise,20

into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false
pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers
cheered her up by their beauty.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_067,joy,45

speeches she had overheard.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_068,sadness,14
"Her faith in her mother was a little shaken
by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged
others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be contented with the
simple wardrobe which suited a poor man’s daughter was weakened by the
unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the
greatest calamities under heaven.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_068,sadness,61

her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from
her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_069,surprise,26

supposed lover.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_069,joy,19

torn last night,” said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling
very uncomfortable.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_069,sadness,31

out yet?",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_070,surprise,15

before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_071,joy,18

bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and
wish she had her old dress on.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_071,surprise,36

opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_072,surprise,27

it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_072,joy,12

Laurie immensely.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_073,joy,13

sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,

bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, “To

this masked marriage.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_079,joy,57

dose of Boswell’s Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_165,joy,34

gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,

brave it out.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_165,fear,47

irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,
whatever he might say to the contrary.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_165,fear,31

minute it was made.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_166,sadness,11

with doll’s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_168,sadness,31

them.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_169,joy,28
"“I’m so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn’t
hold one drop more,” said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo

refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the ‘Jungfrau’ had
sent her.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_169,joy,51

appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and
Beth ran straight into her father’s arms.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_170,joy,28

again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat
turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the
kitchen.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_170,joy,40

precipitately retired.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_170,joy,35

unusually mild expression in her face.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_171,joy,20

Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies
bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,
before they went on to their journey’s end,” answered Beth, adding, as
she slipped out of her father’s arms and went to the instrument, “It’s
singing time now, and I want to be in my old place.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_172,joy,71

have it over quickly,” said Jo pettishly.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_174,anger,22

I should feel like a fool doing it myself,” said Jo, looking alarmed at
the thought.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_174,joy,24

someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was
anything but hospitable.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_174,joy,27
"and Mr. Brooke looked so
hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_175,anger,16

blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called
her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and

"I only want to know if you care for me a little,
Meg.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_175,surprise,13

rather enjoying it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_175,joy,15

German,” broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that
she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_175,joy,36

about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it
rather bewildered him.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_176,sadness,33

if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_176,surprise,25

opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_177,joy,22

easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with
unusual spirit.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_177,joy,22

pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl’s happy young
face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_178,sadness,38

for me a little bit.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_178,joy,45

suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables
actually took her breath away.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_179,surprise,30

Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the
astonished newcomer, “Sister Jo, congratulate us!”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_179,joy,30

he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both
looking so happy that Jo hadn’t the heart to be jealous or dismal.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_179,joy,40

seems a year ago,” answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far
above such common things as bread and butter.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_180,joy,23
"“Hope the next will end better,” muttered Jo, who found it very hard to
see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few
persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or
lessened in any way.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_180,joy,43

spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for ‘Mrs. John Brooke’,

been brought about by his excellent management.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_180,sadness,40

Jo.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_181,sadness,7

couldn’t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,
and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have
the same.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_183,joy,33
"Not an invalid exactly, but never again

serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone’s friend,

learned to know it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_183,joy,48
"A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,
and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to
get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being
spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,
if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the
kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who
watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any
means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and
believed in him with all their hearts.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_184,joy,108

them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of
fascination with which she was endowed.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_184,joy,31

because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer
could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy’s
artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with
good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her
mother put away Meg’s few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally
certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and
neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,
and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute ‘Mis.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_185,joy,112

I can’t talk about it,” with a look that was far better than words.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_186,joy,26

that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in
the big one.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_186,joy,27

themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_186,sadness,21

girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_187,joy,44

the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all
absorbing subject of house keeping.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_187,joy,30

that linen closet was a joke.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_187,joy,13

the knobby parcel with curiosity.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_188,surprise,14

destruction.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_188,joy,20

tone.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_188,surprise,15

tomorrow,” added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque
curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_189,joy,33

it?” asked Jo rather sharply.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_189,surprise,19
"Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,
that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only
afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and
stuffed it into his pocket.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_190,joy,52

talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_190,joy,17

changed the old.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_191,joy,41

minutes with Father quietly in the study,” and Meg ran down to perform
these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she
went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there
was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the
first bird from the nest.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_191,sadness,71

the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains
and always speaks hopefully of ‘being better soon’.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_192,joy,27

the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her
lavender moire with a great rustle.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_192,sadness,24

unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,

a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_193,joy,45

married, Meg cried, “The first kiss for Marmee!” and turning, gave it
with her heart on her lips.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_193,fear,32

life.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_195,joy,40

pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband’s arm, with her hands

genius, especially ambitious young men and women.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_196,surprise,24

the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of
burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic

promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and
the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_196,fear,61

prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her
vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,

had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_196,joy,53
"Other models failing her
for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family
were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running
to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed

with unexpected rapidity.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_197,fear,59

dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that
her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial
of one artistic attempt, at least.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_197,joy,41

had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she
never became a great artist.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_197,joy,28

turn out well.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_200,sadness,9

living, even if they bore no other fruit.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_205,joy,38
"“Do you know her?” asked Jo, with sudden interest.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_206,surprise,9
"Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to
keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all
hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred
dollars fell into her lap.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_207,sadness,63
"If the amiable
gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense
happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would devote his
leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo valued the
letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and after years
of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do
something, though it was only to write a sensation story.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_207,joy,76
"“You can do better than this, Jo.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_207,joy,7

satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with
a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_207,joy,27

ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that
she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_208,joy,34
"Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is
more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this
important subject,” said Jo, calling a family council.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_208,joy,36

for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her
to do better next time.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_208,joy,26

outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_208,joy,21

metaphysical’, it isn’t my fault, for I know nothing about such things,
except what I hear father say, sometimes.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_209,joy,29

pleasing everyone, she took everyone’s advice, and like the old man and
his donkey in the fable suited nobody.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_209,joy,23

well and had apparently done so ill.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_210,sadness,20

tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of
dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_210,sadness,22

derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which

sorry, but I was so busy,” and Meg’s tears began again.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_214,sadness,12

Sallie’s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because
she had not got them.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_217,sadness,18

her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value
more—his money.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_217,joy,28

her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_217,fear,28

it weighed upon her conscience.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_217,sadness,16

spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn’t
become her, after all, and the words ‘fifty dollars’ seemed stamped
like a pattern down each breadth.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_218,sadness,42

night, Meg’s heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,
she was afraid of her husband.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_218,fear,26

“Don’t go and hide.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_218,joy,14

minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,
saying with a little quiver in his voice, “I was afraid of this.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_219,fear,35
"It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so
quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he
stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry
herself to sleep.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_220,fear,41
"A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the
discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat
reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_220,sadness,33
"They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband
better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,
given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him
a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings
and failures of those he loved.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_220,joy,60

early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning

little wife.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_220,joy,33

parlor, and I’ll send ’em down to you,” with which somewhat involved
reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_220,joy,22

caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with
two babies instead of one.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_221,joy,30
"No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough
to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the
unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that
Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_221,joy,43

it,” said Jo, when she got her breath.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_221,surprise,27

naturally laid the blame upon Jo.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_225,joy,25

imitate what is called ‘a charming girl’.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_225,joy,14

was no knowing where she would stop.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_225,fear,20
"A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears
to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with
curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the
fun.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_225,joy,37
But what could she do?,Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_225,surprise,5

you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_226,sadness,41

"You haven’t a bit of proper
pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to
speak,” said Amy despairingly.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_227,sadness,23
"Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with
the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her
misdemeanors.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_227,sadness,24
"An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children
speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the
hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted
herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_227,joy,44
"She
listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and
poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that “Tom Brown was a brick,”
regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a
visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma
to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left
in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and
dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an
inspired Frenchwoman.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_228,joy,89

to her heart’s content.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_228,joy,16
"One small child was
poking turtles with Amy’s cherished parasol, a second was eating
gingerbread over Jo’s best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her
gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her
damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come
again, “It was such fun to hear about Laurie’s larks.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_228,joy,59

drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I’m deeply
grateful.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_229,joy,28

work.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_231,surprise,11

for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but
unfortunately, we don’t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see
what goes on in the minds of our friends.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_231,sadness,47

as I like,” replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old
lady to smile affably.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_231,joy,31

ball for her.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_232,joy,29

peep into Jo’s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry
that it was impossible to help laughing.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_232,joy,43
"No hint of this had
reached the culprits, however, and Amy’s dismay can be imagined, when,
the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches
to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the
supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a
cold look...",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_233,sadness,55

little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to

her full of surprise and trouble.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_233,surprise,41

of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this

came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_234,joy,16

appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,
feeling that virtue was not always its own reward.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_235,sadness,33

table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_236,sadness,28

wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and

masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only
came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy’s taste, and
apparently enjoying themselves very much.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_237,joy,35

more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the
conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_237,joy,35

enjoying herself.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_237,joy,16

Father,” said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister’s work.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_238,surprise,21

news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,

such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
visions of art than herself.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_240,joy,50

drawing teacher.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_240,joy,46

nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_241,joy,59

they opened their mouths to roar.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_258,joy,59

she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny
window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_258,joy,35

laughed, and said, “That must have been Professor Bhaer, he’s always
doing things of that sort.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_259,joy,26

her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought, and
gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf now
and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if
finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,
while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look
that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French
than German.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_260,joy,84

she is short and I’m tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a
failure.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_261,sadness,29

crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing
quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray him.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_265,joy,59

public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on
bigger beanstalks than hers.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_268,fear,26

perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the
gentlemen that her little fiction of ‘my friend’ was considered a good

he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_270,joy,49

ballast for much romance—had been stricken out.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_270,surprise,65

model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational
literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,
she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_271,joy,44

headache after it was all over.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_274,joy,42
"It dawned upon her gradually that the
world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,

that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and
intellect was to be the only God.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_274,surprise,49

impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build
character upon in womanhood.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_278,joy,52

out’, if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with
characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now

been so good to me.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_281,joy,69

found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,
and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo

"The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look
round, and say “How beautiful this is!”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_323,joy,21
"It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as
preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the
needle was ‘so heavy’, and put it down forever.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_323,sadness,34
"Talking wearied her,
faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil
spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble
flesh.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_323,sadness,27
"Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching
hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced
to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the
bitter cry, “Help me, help me!” and to feel that there was no help.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_323,sadness,48
"Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,
heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her
lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the
transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too
deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was
trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the
life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music
she loved so well.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_324,joy,91
"Henceforth, safe across the river,
I shall see forever more
A beloved, household spirit
Waiting for me on the shore.
Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,
Guardian angels shall become,
And the sister gone before me
By their hands shall lead me home.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_325,sadness,44
"Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought
a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth’s face, for her one regret had
been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that
her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the
despair she feared.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_325,sadness,55
"Have I been all that to you, Jo?”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_325,surprise,8

pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of
other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the
immortality of love.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_326,joy,36
"With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her
ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with
grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic
patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent
joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom
full of dread.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_326,joy,63
"But a bird sang
blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly
at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction
over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace
that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked
God that Beth was well at last.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_326,joy,60

all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it
grew easier every day.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_329,surprise,30

the other, and was happy.”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_330,joy,20

her, I’m afraid,” and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had
been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks
before.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_330,fear,37
"Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once
decided to answer, “Yes, thank you,” but now she said, “No, thank you,”
kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,
and she found that something more than money and position was needed to
satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes
and fears.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_331,joy,66

remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so
unwomanly.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_331,sadness,18

duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy’s letter
luxuriously.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_332,joy,31

met her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and
they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the
Italian lakes.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_332,sadness,32
"She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the
family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for since it was
too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence
soften her sorrow.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_332,sadness,40
"But her heart was very heavy, she longed to be at
home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for
Laurie to come and comfort her.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_332,sadness,28
"Everything about her mutely
suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black
ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her
face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to
Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only
ornament.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_333,sadness,57
"He did
not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,
were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_333,joy,25

beginning to fear you wouldn’t come,” she said, trying in vain to speak
quite naturally.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_334,surprise,30

for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_334,joy,22

well and happy, and I mustn’t wish her back, but I dread the going
home, much as I long to see them all.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_334,fear,25

his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,
a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully
for her alone.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_334,joy,38
"For an hour this new pair walked
and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which
gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell
warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and
sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_335,joy,54
"But when
the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved
presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo
found her promise very hard to keep.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,31
"How could she ‘comfort Father and
Mother’ when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her
sister, how could she ‘make the house cheerful’ when all its light and
warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old
home for the new, and where in all the world could she ‘find some
useful, happy work to do’, that would take the place of the loving
service which had been its own reward?",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,78
"She tried in a blind, hopeless
way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it
seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made
heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,43
"It was not
fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,
only disappointment, trouble and hard work.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,24
"Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came
over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,
devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that
never seemed to grow any easier.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,45
"Often she started up at night,
thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed
made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, “Oh, Beth,
come back!",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,33
"For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her
sister’s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with
words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo’s, and broken
whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went
hand-in-hand with natural sorrow.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_337,sadness,62
"Feeling this, Jo’s burden
seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more
endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother’s arms.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_338,joy,25
"Then, sitting in Beth’s little chair close beside him, Jo told her
troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that
discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all
the sad bewilderment which we call despair.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_338,sadness,44

only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to
serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_338,joy,36

thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called ‘the church of
one member’, and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered
cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_338,joy,31
"As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister
Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly
impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and
children, and how much they were all doing for each other.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_338,joy,48
"Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo’s old spirit, but
she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her
power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
Meg’s most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_339,joy,52

the bag.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_339,sadness,16

had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if
she did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_339,joy,30

had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,
and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to
devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to
them as they had to her?",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_339,joy,48
"And if difficulties were necessary to increase
the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless,
ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and
cheerfully live for others?",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_340,surprise,36
"That always used to make you happy,” said her
mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_340,joy,17
"Jo never knew how it happened, but something got
into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,
for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it,
much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her
utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_340,surprise,61

this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!”",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_342,joy,22

not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one
sister should have all she asked, the other nothing.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_342,sadness,33
"It was her favorite way of spending the hour of
dusk.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_343,joy,11

tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she
was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and
how little she seemed to have accomplished.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_343,sadness,36

to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_343,joy,16
"Just recollect
the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and
petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out
of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches
the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old
feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little
attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_344,joy,76

was down on him like a flash.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_345,sadness,18

it!” cried Jo, with uplifted hands.",Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,1868,LM_349,joy,19

"She
resigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s
blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating
from her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,
was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy
house—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the
daughter.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_119,joy,56

between women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_121,joy,17

could do the same thing on his flute.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_122,joy,25

brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,
just the sort of person for a governess.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_122,joy,29

moulded only for pure and delicate joys.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_124,joy,45

to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled
by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will
sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_147,sadness,44

had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to
tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,

slight sob and eyes full of tears.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_154,sadness,18

reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been
a show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,

greater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was
agreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_161,joy,26

her husband.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_164,joy,12

long while before.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_165,joy,19

of her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_170,fear,26
"Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach
to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so
much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving
out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings
around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a
gentle smile— “It is very good of you to be anxious about me.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_170,sadness,80

her pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,

worse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that, going into
the dining-room, he threw himself on the sofa, and in answer to his

wedding journey was being discussed.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_273,joy,20

the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some
trouble.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_273,joy,24

husband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at
her thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had

exaggerated a past solace.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_279,sadness,43

mournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_284,joy,21

that relief, observing that he had already had too many public details
urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea
asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which

recipient of praise.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_284,joy,80

was no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as
he could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out to be
something more troublesome than he had conceived.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_323,sadness,37

seemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him with

hate.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_331,sadness,11

cordially.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_339,joy,13

Lowick and tell us more of this.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_339,joy,16

it will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement
to believe that I may win Mary.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_445,joy,34
"It was a little too provoking even for _her_
self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the
disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a
nightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family
should suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her
vexation had fermented the more actively because of its total
repression towards her husband.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_445,sadness,66

Caleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_447,surprise,18

ever will,” she ended, merrily.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_450,joy,15

whole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new
attitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_450,sadness,29

for going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to
be always clear that she loved Fred best.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_450,joy,26

Captain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to say, was
detested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop “parting his hair
from brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not followed by Tertius

thing to say on every topic.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_451,sadness,67

Rosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to Loamford to
see some brother officers stationed there.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_452,joy,31

had travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared
to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s
mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and
looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored
wisdom alone.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_452,sadness,61

more acute pain which dominated them—the pain of foreseeing that
Rosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of
disappointment and unhappiness to her.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_547,sadness,50

woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these
opposing “bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late

seeing on a background of prosperity.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_582,sadness,54

would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to
her surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is
easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered
communication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being
pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the
superiority.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_584,surprise,70

alternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the
family at Quallingham.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_588,sadness,35

he was entirely reserved towards her—for he dreaded to expose his

painfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of
what could affect her happiness.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_589,sadness,46

felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as
one which was inwardly whole and without blemish.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_603,sadness,29

the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth

she will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.”",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_605,joy,22
"She
found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything
remarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones
which startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and
advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a
bookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which
filled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless,
without self-possession enough to speak.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_605,surprise,74

heart.",Middlemarch,George Eliot,1871,GE_609,sadness,37

evening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than

imagine: she was under the first great shock that had shattered her
dream-world in which she had been easily confident of herself and
critical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of

may be very dear—it has taken hold of us unawares—it is so hard, it may

there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure:

arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my
sad childhood.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_056,sadness,41
"Thus
restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went
on that Miss Temple fully believed me.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_056,joy,20
"She
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully— “But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_057,joy,25

have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_057,joy,21
"We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
delicate fare she liberally supplied.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_058,joy,41
"Has a girl of fourteen a heart
large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure,
full, fervid eloquence?",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_058,surprise,21
"The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,
I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of
which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,
hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the
spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the
heart.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_059,sadness,62

days of liberty with her?",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_062,surprise,12
"True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
my heart.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_063,joy,52
"How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship,
which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_063,joy,30
"But Helen
was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight
to I knew not what room upstairs.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_063,sadness,23

I knew instantly now!",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_064,surprise,16

experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a
desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_064,fear,27

see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last
kiss, exchange with her one last word.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_065,fear,30

sleep till I had spoken to you.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_065,sadness,23

long silence, she resumed, still whispering— “I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_066,joy,34

you near me.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_066,sadness,29

class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I
discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I
altered.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_068,sadness,39
"At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
county, and consequently was lost to me.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_068,sadness,30
"I imagined myself only to
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the
afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned
on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming
process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or
rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been
breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural
element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_068,surprise,100

failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_072,sadness,29

Bessie!",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_074,joy,12

cried, and we both went into the parlour.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_074,joy,18
"“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_075,fear,9
"I said this laughing:
I perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
shape denote admiration.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_075,joy,19
"I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an
exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but
gratification.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_075,joy,48
"It is as fine a picture as any
Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies
themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_075,surprise,30
"“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_075,joy,10
"I wonder if she lives alone except this little
girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be
able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing
one’s best does not always answer.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_077,joy,47
"“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
the cat on her knee; “I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
pleasant living here now with a companion.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_079,joy,38
"My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I
drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish
that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_080,joy,39
"I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_080,joy,22
"I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was
for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
appeared at the door.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_082,joy,55
"I told her I liked it very
much.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_082,joy,8
"“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting
out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come
and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener:
great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_082,fear,51
"The equality between her
and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so
much the better—my position was all the freer.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_083,joy,26
"“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_083,joy,7
"Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame
Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven
years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to
take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the
pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of
readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be
much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_083,joy,92
"I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
tongue of Madame Pierrot.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_084,joy,17

about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_084,joy,23

gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,

house as mama.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_085,sadness,15
"I felt
a conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a
quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs.
Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
of her mind and character.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_090,joy,53

me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_091,joy,17
"To pass its threshold was to
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too
still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and
ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_097,sadness,86

Miss Eyre?",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_101,surprise,7

did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was
tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy
to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_117,joy,47
"But unluckily the
Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she
affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more
like me than she.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_121,sadness,44

pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to
a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_121,surprise,32

quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_131,joy,16

better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,
more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener
enjoyments.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_131,joy,32

Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if

attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_131,surprise,47

life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet
lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_134,anger,34
"A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and
ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and
distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of
the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests

laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched

in love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised

dead-weights from the house.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_149,surprise,64

could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to
notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would
never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his
attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with
the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious
eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object
too mean to merit observation.",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_155,joy,98

intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this
guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s

woman the sun shines on.”",Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,1847,CB_156,joy,30
"It surprised me when I first
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man
unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a
wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the
parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or
Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled
